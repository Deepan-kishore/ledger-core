# In-memory ledger (Java 17 assessment)

A small, runnable bank-ledger engine. It replays a fixed 10-event fixture over six business days for two
accounts, charges overdraft fees, handles card-style holds, reverses a backdated debit, splits a credit
into instalments, and capitalizes interest.

> **Status: money types and input.** `ledger.money` and `ledger.input` (accounts, events, the 10-event
> fixture) are written and tested; the engine and report are not written yet. This README grows with the code.

## Package layout

| Package | Holds |
|---|---|
| `ledger.money` | `CurrencyCode` (AED 2 decimals, BHD 3) and `Money` (exact, scale-checked amounts) |
| `ledger.input` | `Account`, `EventKind`, `SourceEvent` (one event as supplied) and `Fixture` (the brief's E1–E10, in order) |

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or newer (the build compiles with `--release 17`; it was verified on OpenJDK 25.0.2).
- Apache Maven 3.6.3+ (verified with Maven 3.10.0). No Maven wrapper is included.
- The first build downloads JUnit and Maven plugins into `~/.m2`. That is build setup only; the program
  itself has no runtime dependencies and stores nothing.

## Commands (from a clean checkout)

```bash
mvn test       # compiles and runs the test suite (11 tests so far)
mvn package    # runs the suite again and builds target/in-memory-ledger-1.0.0.jar
```
